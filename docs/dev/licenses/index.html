<P>
    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public
    License, my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is
    that no Perl script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you
    explicitly put said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.
</P>
<P>
    Furthermore, any object code linked with perl does not
    automatically fall under the terms of the GPL, provided such
    object code only adds definitions of subroutines and variables,
    and does not otherwise impair the resulting interpreter from
    executing any standard Perl script.  I consider linking in C
    subroutines in this manner to be the moral equivalent of defining
    subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You may sell such an
    object file as proprietary provided that you provide or offer to
    provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General Public
    License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input to
    the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping
    of a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you
    provide or offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the
    GPL.  (The fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the
    same binary file is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)
</P>
<P>
    This is my interpretation of the GPL.  If you still have concerns
    or difficulties understanding my intent, feel free to contact me.
    Of course, the Artistic License spells all this out for your
    protection, so you may prefer to use that.
